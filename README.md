# Emerging Technologies Assessment

**Name:** Gareth O'Leary

**Student No:** G00375321

## Project Description

This repository is the main assessment for **Emerging Technologies** which includes two jupyter notebooks:

1. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
2. Quantum-Deutsch Jupyter Notebook

**Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook** contains an overview of the scikit-learn Python library explaining what it is and how it is used. The notebook also contains three demonstrations of scikit-learn algorithms with plots and visualisations.

**Quantum-Deutsch Jupyter Notebook** contains an overview of Quantum computing and explains what makes it different to classical computing. The notebook also gives an explanation of Deutschâ€™s algorithm and code simulating it using qiskit.

## Notebooks

You can view both notebook in static or dynamic form by clicking the following images:

## Credits

### Scikit-learn
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

A big part of the learning outcomes of this module was to get familiar with scikit-learn. I heavily relied on this for demonstrating and explaining the different algorithms.

### Qiskit 
https://qiskit.org/

Qiskit was an essential part of simulating code for the demonstration of Deutsch's Algorithm.
