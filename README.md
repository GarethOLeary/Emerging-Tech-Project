# Emerging Technologies Assessment

**Name:** Gareth O'Leary

**Student No:** G00375321

## Project Description

This repository is the main assessment for **Emerging Technologies** which includes two jupyter notebooks:

1. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
2. Quantum-Deutsch Jupyter Notebook

**Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook** contains an overview of the scikit-learn Python library explaining what it is and how it is used. The notebook also contains three demonstrations of scikit-learn algorithms with plots and visualisations. In this notebook, I give an in depth look into Classification, Regression and Clustering which I learned about throughout the module.

**Quantum-Deutsch Jupyter Notebook** contains an overview of Quantum computing and explains what makes it different to classical computing. The notebook also gives an explanation of Deutschâ€™s algorithm and code simulating it using qiskit.

## Notebooks

## Credits

### Scikit-learn
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

A big part of the learning outcomes of this module was to get familiar with scikit-learn. I heavily relied on this for demonstrating and explaining the different algorithms.

### Qiskit 
https://qiskit.org/

Qiskit was an essential part of simulating code for the demonstration of Deutsch's Algorithm. 

### Docker 
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

This is the first time I have used docker, I expanded my knowledge of how to use it and understand the different commands. I used docker throughout the module to run my notebooks. 

### Jupyter 
https://jupyter.org/

I used Jupyter to create my notebooks, plots and visualistaions.

###  UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

I used the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository for the three different datasets I used to conduct my analysis on for my Scikit-learn notebook.
