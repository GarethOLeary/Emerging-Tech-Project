    "Quantum computing focuses on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory. At the heart of quantum physics is a concept known as Amplitudes. Amplitudes are closely related to probabilities, but the key difference is probability is always a number from zero to one, amplitudes are complex numbers which means they obey different rules. A **Qubit** is a basic computational unit and is made up of sub atomic particles. Qubit's can be 0, 1 or a linear computation of 0 and 1. Unmeasured Qubits's exist in a state called **Superposition**, where each qubit has some amplitude for being zero and some amplitude for being one. When two or more Qubit's are in the state of Superposition, they relate to each other through **Entanglement**. This means that their final outcomes will be mathematcially related even if we don't know yet what they are. In order to get an answer from the Quantum system that isn't a random outcome of probability, **Interference** has to be used. Interference is when waves in a pool hit each other, one wave is above the surface and the other wave is below the surface, when they collide they cancel each other out. "
